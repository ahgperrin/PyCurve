Description: # PyCurve  Python Package
        
        
        ### Object oriented with a main Class Curve wich allows user to gather a yield curve with two arrays, maturity and yield.
        ### User can use this market curve and then use this curve in order to do stochastics or interpolation. Simple to get rate, or discount factor from different method.
        ## Allows user to interpolate Yield curve with different models :
            - Linear Interpolation
            - Cubic Spline Interpolation
            - Nelson Siegel
            - Nelson Siegel Svensson
            - Bjork Christensen
            - Bjork Christensen Augmented
            
        ## Allows User to generate stochastic process under Vasicek and Hull and white
