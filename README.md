# PyCurve  Python Package


### Object oriented with a main Class Curve wich allows user to gather a yield curve with two arrays, maturity and yield.
### User can use this market curve and then use this curve in order to do stochastics or interpolation. Simple to get rate, or discount factor from different method.
## Allows user to interpolate Yield curve with different models :
    - Linear Interpolation
    - Cubic Spline Interpolation
    - Nelson Siegel
    - Nelson Siegel Svensson
    - Bjork Christensen
    - Bjork Christensen Augmented
    
## Allows User to generate stochastic process under Vasicek and Hull and white
